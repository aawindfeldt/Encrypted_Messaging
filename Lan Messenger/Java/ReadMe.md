Java Lan Chat source code
GUI needs: button named listenButton, button named sendButton, textfield named receivePort, textfield named targetPort, textfield named 
ipTextField, textfield named msgTextField, textarea named chat.

How it works: 
Make sure friend's target port and your listen port are the same, then vice versa. Enter localHost into the ipTextField
if your and your friend are under the same IP Address. Still working out a way to communicate to other IP addresses. Click the listen
button to start the chat session. Then type your message and click send.

Important: 
This is only the source code. There is no executable application in this file. This application was created with NetBeans ide.
